CobwebKit
=========

The worlds worst browser engine.

Currently it is able to:
* Read in and parse a HTML file
* Access any element by tag name
* Get styles from style tags on the page
* Parse styles into a selector and rules
* Apply styles through the HTML tree
* Renders text only nodes
* Renders with correct CSS styles

To do:
* Implement support for WAY more styles
* Make parsing and rendering a little more robust
* Create a set of default styles
* Add support for inline styles
* Add support for link tags
* Add support for a tags/links?
