CobwebKit
=========

The worlds worst browser engine.

Currently it is able to:
* Read in and parse a HTML file
* Access any element by tag name
* Get styles from style tags on the page
* Parse styles into a selector and rules
* Apply styles through the HTML tree
* Renders text nodes only
* Renders with correct CSS styles, but with very basic cascading
* Supports CSS to change font style/size/weight, color and margins

To do:
* Selector specificity
* Add support for img tags
* Make a distinction between block and inline elements

* Make the parser able to have text and nodes alongside each other
* Add support for inline styles
* Add support for link tags
* Add support for a tags/links?
